# 🍉 MeloDoro

_Because studying should be fun too_

## What's This All About?

MeloDoro transforms your boring study routine into a delightfully visual experience. Watch a watermelon slice fill up as you focus, track your daily goals with an animated watermelon glass, and build study streaks that would make even the most dedicated fruit farmer jealous.

## Features

### 🎯 **Smart Study Timer**

- Custom watermelon slice that fills as you study (because progress should be visible AND adorable)
- Quick-start presets: 15, 25, 45, or 60 minutes (for when you can't decide how long to study)
- Fully customizable duration (5-300 minutes, because we don't judge your study marathons)
- Satisfying completion animations (dopamine hits included)

### 📊 **Goal Tracking That Actually Motivates**

- Set daily study goals from 15 minutes to 8 hours (we believe in you!)
- Watch your watermelon glass fill up throughout the day
- Quick goal presets for the indecisive among us
- Today's session history (proof that you actually did something productive)

### 📈 **Stats That Tell Your Story**

- **Day View**: 24-hour timeline showing when you're most productive
- **Month View**: Color-coded calendar that makes your study habits look like modern art
- **Year View**: Because sometimes you need the big picture to feel accomplished
- **Charts & Analytics**: Bar charts, line graphs, and session breakdowns (data nerds, this one's for you)

### 🏆 **Achievements Worth Bragging About**

- 8 unlockable achievements from "First Steps" to "Century Club"
- Track your study streaks (current and longest, because competition with yourself is the best kind)
- Progress bars that actually make you want to fill them up

## Why Watermelon?

Great question! We could have gone with tomato (too cliché), oranges (too citrusy), or bananas (not a circle?). But watermelons? They're:

- My sister's favorite fruit.
- Pink and green (aesthetically pleasing color combo)
